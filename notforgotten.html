<p>Gifthands is a group of musicians and singers who are dedicated to put smiles on the faces of the less previleged with their God given gifts. With God's help and people's support, we've been able to host five editions of GIFTEDHANDS charity concert campaigns in recent years.<br><br>The first was in the year 2012 with an album launch. The second in December 2013,the third and fourth editions in march and june respectively.<br><br>However, due to financial constriants, we were unable to do any outreach till the year 2018 where we had the likes of woli agba as guest. We also planned another outreach for the year 2020, but the upsurge of COVID restrained our activities. With the effect of COVID on businesses and finance in general, we took our time to plan and restrategize a relaunch with focus on consistency</p>
